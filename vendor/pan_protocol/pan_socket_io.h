/*
 * Name:
 *   pan_socket_io.h
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Socket I/O functions designed for use with the PANGU network protocol.
 *
 * Description:
 *   This file contains low-level functions (pan_socket_read/pan_socket_write)
 *   for sending and receiving data over sockets with basic support for packet
 *   fragmentation. Short reads and short writes must be handled by users of
 *   these functions.
 *
 *   This file also contains medium-level functions for reading and writing
 *   values of specific C data types in a portable format for PANGU systems.
 *   Short reads and short writes must be handled by users of these functions.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   The integer value returned by every read and write function declared
 *   below is the number of bytes successfully read/written. The table below
 *   defines the number of bytes that each supported data type occupies and
 *   it is up to the caller to ensure that the result of these calls matches
 *   the corresponding value in the table:
 *
 *        uchar/char     1
 *        bool           1
 *        short/ushort   2
 *        long/ulong     4
 *        float          4
 *        double         8
 *
 * For readable code use pan_socket_read_*() and pan_socket_write_*(). For
 * optimal code use multiple pan_socket_poke_*() calls into a single buffer
 * followed by a single pan_socket_write(). This gives a 1000x performance
 * boost under Windows and Linux ....
 *
 * Language:
 *   ANSI C 89
